Ahhh! My first form is almost finished... Just thought i'd blog this function (even though it's probably hanging arround a million other places on the net).

I needed to ensure a few fields were always lowercase so I applied theÂ translate function as a rule to the required fields:

```
translate(.,"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWYXZ", "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwyxz")
```

"." (above) referes to the current field.

The rule it self looks like this:
