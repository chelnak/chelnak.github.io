Recently I've found myself doing a lot of API queries with PowerShell. I often have a URI with a lot of query parameters and escaping them manually can be cumbersome and time-consuming.

To make life easier, I have started to use `[uri]::EscapeUriString(*string stringToEscape*)`. It takes one parameter, which is the string to escape. Here is an example to illustrate its usage:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/chelnak/5c11b61c10c3dc56af2130a0d66ef873.js"></script>

To reverse an escaped string you can use `[uri]::UnescapeDataString(*string stringToUnescape*)`.

An ![interesting issue](https://github.com/jakkulabs/PowervRA/issues/121) was raised on one of my community projects recently. A contributor pointed out that one of our functions did not work when you chose to filter by name and the string passed to the Name parameter contained an ampersand (&).

```powershell
Get-vRABusinessGroup -Name "Hello & Hello"
```

The REST API query was using a $filter parameter to return results where the name property was equal to the string passed to the Name parameter of the function. For example:

```
$URI = "/identity/api/tenants/$($TenantId)/subtenants?`$filter=name%20eq%20'Hello & Hello'"
```

In this case you should use **[uri]::EscapeDataString(string stringToEscape)**.Â This method will also escape special characters within a string. So & becomes %26 and allows the request to succeed.
